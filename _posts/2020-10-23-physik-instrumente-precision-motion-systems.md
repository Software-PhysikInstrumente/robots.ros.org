## Physik Instrumente PI

PI is a leading provider of nanopositioning products and systems. All key technologies are developed, manufactured, and qualified in-house by PI: piezo components, actuators and motors, magnetic drives, guiding systems, nanometrology sensors, electronic amplifiers, digital controllers, and software.

### Highlights:

*   Complete systems consisting of mechanical system, controller, and software
*   Broad range of drive technologies: piezoelectric drives, electric motors, and electromagnetic drives
*   Various systems: linear stages, rotation stages, hexapods, and custom solutions

### PI ROS Driver

This package contains the ROS Driver for Hexapods from Physik Intrumente (PI).
This includes a controller manager as standalone node as well as launch files and configurations as easy starting point for your ROS application.
The package is using ROS control and builds on the known interfaces and paradigms.
The ROS driver works for all PI Hexapod types. For simulation and offline use currently only a model of the H-811.I2 is available. Models for other hexapod types on request.
Please also note that the “PIHexapodemulator” – a virtual machine to simulate complete hexapod systems - can also be used in combination with the PI ROS driver.

### PI Manipulators in Motion

#### Fastest Way to Program a 6DOF Hexapod 6-Axis Motion Platform: Software, Mechanics, Controller

The video shows PI's expertise in hexapod 6DOF motion platform design and the ease of operation for the user: mechanics, controller  and sofware tools were optimized over 25 years.
A hexapod is based on a 6-axis (XYZ, Pitch, Roll, Yaw) actuator system arranged in parallel between a top and bottom platform. PI parallel kinematics (PKM) precision positioning systems have many advantages over serial kinematics stages, such as lower inertia, improved dynamics, smaller package size and higher stiffness. In addition hexaods are more flexible than conventional 6 axis positioners.
